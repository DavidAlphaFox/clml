** Requirements
  + Language: SBCL, Allegro or Lispworks
  + Platform: Posix compatibile platforms (Windows, Linux, BSD and derivatives)
  + Optionally Intel Math Kernel Library
  + ASDF3 and optionally Quicklisp (This document assumes [[http://quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]])


  Note: Default heapsize should be around 2560K for SBCL this can be
done by set with the switch
  sbcl --dynamic-space-size 2560

Currently development is taking place mostly on SBCL. For the near future SBCL is most stable platform.
