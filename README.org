machine learning package written in Common Lisp developed at 
[[http://cl-www.msi.co.jp][MSI]].

This repository contains is a authorized fork of the original CLML with the following goals in mind:
  + Remove dependent libraries available from the Quicklisp repository
  + Re-factor code to support Quicklisp packaging

  + Support for SBCL, CCL, LispWorks and Allegro Common Lisp
  + Improve documentation
