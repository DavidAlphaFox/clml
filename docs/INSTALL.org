** Requirements
  + Language: SBCL, CCL, Allegro or Lispworks
  + Platform: Posix compatibile platforms (Windows, Linux, BSD and derivatives)
  + ASDF3 and optionally Quicklisp (This document assumes [[http://quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]])


  Note: Default heapsize should be around 2560K  (On some systems it may need to be greater) for SBCL this can be
done by set with the switch
#+BEGIN_SRC
  sbcl &#x2013;dynamic-space-size 2560
#+END_SRC    
If using sbcl via roswell this can be done by
#+BEGIN_SRC
ros dynamic-space-size=2560 run
#+END_SRC
Currently development is taking place mostly on SBCL. For the near future SBCL is most stable platform.
